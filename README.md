## Backend (Express + MongoDB)

The project now includes a Node.js/Express backend under `server/` providing authentication, expenses, categories, budgets, recurring expenses, and stats.

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` at the repository root:
```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=super_secret_change_me
PORT=4000
```

### Install & Run
```bash
npm install
npm run server   # backend (http://localhost:4000)
npm run dev      # frontend (http://localhost:5173 by default)
# or both
npm run dev:full
```

### API Endpoints (Summary)
| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | /api/health | Health check |
| POST | /api/auth/register | Create user (email, password, name) |
| POST | /api/auth/login | Login returns `{ token, user }` |
| POST | /api/expenses | Create expense |
| GET | /api/expenses | List expenses (`?month=YYYY-MM` optional) |
| GET | /api/expenses/recent | Last 10 expenses for dashboard |
| GET | /api/expenses/stats/categories | Category totals (`?month=`) |
| DELETE | /api/expenses/:id | Delete expense |
| POST | /api/categories | Create category |
| GET | /api/categories | List categories |
| DELETE | /api/categories/:id | Delete category |
| PUT | /api/budgets | Upsert monthly budget `{ month, amount }` |
| GET | /api/budgets/:month | Get budget summary `{ budget, spent, remaining }` |
| POST | /api/recurring | Create recurring expense |
| GET | /api/recurring | List recurring expenses |
| PUT | /api/recurring/:id/toggle | Toggle active state |
| POST | /api/recurring/run | Manually run due recurring items |
| GET | /api/stats/summary | Current month total + percent change |

Protected endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

### Model Shapes (Simplified)
```
User: { email, passwordHash, name }
Expense: { userId, description, category, amount, date }
Category: { userId, name }
Budget: { userId, month, amount }
RecurringExpense: { userId, description, category, amount, interval, startDate, nextRun, active }
```

### Frontend Integration
Fetch recent expenses for `RecentTransactions`:
```ts
const res = await fetch('/api/expenses/recent', { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }});
const transactions = await res.json();
```
Chart data from `/api/expenses/stats/categories?month=YYYY-MM` already matches `{ category, amount }`.

Budget panel from `/api/budgets/2025-11` response.

### Recurring Runner
Call `/api/recurring/run` to generate due expenses (later replace with scheduled job/cron).

### Next Improvements
- Pagination & filtering
- Password reset / email verification
- Better validation & error envelopes
- Automated recurring job (cron, serverless)
- Role-based access if needed
