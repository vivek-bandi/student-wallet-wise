# Welcome to your Lovable project

## Project info

**URL**: https://lovable.dev/projects/0abda645-d3ba-4154-842b-e68a8ac52a7b

## Environment Setup

This project has separate environment files for frontend and backend:

**Frontend (root directory)**
- `.env` - Frontend environment variables (Vite)
- `.env.example` - Template for frontend env vars

**Backend (server directory)**
- `server/.env` - Backend environment variables
- `server/.env.example` - Template for backend env vars

### Quick Setup
```bash
# 1. Copy example files and set your values
cp .env.example .env
cp server/.env.example server/.env

# 2. Edit server/.env and add your MongoDB connection string
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://your-connection-string

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Run backend and frontend
npm run dev:full
```

## Backend (Express + MongoDB)

The project now includes a Node.js/Express backend under `server/` providing authentication, expenses, categories, budgets, recurring expenses, and stats.

### Backend Deployment
The server has its own `package.json` file in the `server/` directory for independent deployment.

To deploy the server separately:
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start  # or npm run dev for development
```

### Environment Variables
Create environment files:
1. `.env` at the repository root (for frontend):
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

2. `server/.env` in the server directory (for backend):
```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=super_secret_change_me
PORT=3000
```

### Install & Run
```bash
npm install
npm run server   # backend (http://localhost:3000)
npm run dev      # frontend (http://localhost:5173 by default)
# or both
npm run dev:full
```

### Authentication Flow
1. Visit the home page at `http://localhost:5173`
2. Click "Sign Up" to create a new account
3. After signup, you'll be automatically logged in and redirected to the dashboard
4. The dashboard shows your expenses with options to add new expenses
5. Click "Logout" to sign out

### API Endpoints (Summary)
| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | /api/health | Health check |
| POST | /api/auth/register | Create user (email, password, name) |
| POST | /api/auth/login | Login returns `{ token, user }` |
| POST | /api/expenses | Create expense |
| GET | /api/expenses | List expenses (`?month=YYYY-MM` optional) |
| GET | /api/expenses/recent | Last 10 expenses for dashboard |
| GET | /api/expenses/stats/categories | Category totals (`?month=`) |
| DELETE | /api/expenses/:id | Delete expense |
| POST | /api/categories | Create category |
| GET | /api/categories | List categories |
| DELETE | /api/categories/:id | Delete category |
| PUT | /api/budgets | Upsert monthly budget `{ month, amount }` |
| GET | /api/budgets/:month | Get budget summary `{ budget, spent, remaining }` |
| POST | /api/recurring | Create recurring expense |
| GET | /api/recurring | List recurring expenses |
| PUT | /api/recurring/:id/toggle | Toggle active state |
| POST | /api/recurring/run | Manually run due recurring items |
| GET | /api/stats/summary | Current month total + percent change |

Protected endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

### Model Shapes (Simplified)
```
User: { email, passwordHash, name }
Expense: { userId, description, category, amount, date }
Category: { userId, name }
Budget: { userId, month, amount }
RecurringExpense: { userId, description, category, amount, interval, startDate, nextRun, active }
```

### Frontend Integration
Fetch recent expenses for `RecentTransactions`:
```ts
const res = await fetch('/api/expenses/recent', { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }});
const transactions = await res.json();
```
Chart data from `/api/expenses/stats/categories?month=YYYY-MM` already matches `{ category, amount }`.

Budget panel from `/api/budgets/2025-11` response.

### Recurring Runner
Call `/api/recurring/run` to generate due expenses (later replace with scheduled job/cron).

### Next Improvements
- Pagination & filtering
- Password reset / email verification
- Better validation & error envelopes
- Automated recurring job (cron, serverless)
- Role-based access if needed
